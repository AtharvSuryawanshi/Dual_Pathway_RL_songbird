This folder has a bunch of jupyter notebooks essentially used for trial and testing of model and its inner workings.
1. deepdive 1 : Original jumping function and its inner workings.
2. deepdive copy : A better yet, crooked looking mathematical jugglery for the jump function
3. deepdive copy 2 : An equally better, but decent looking jump function which is also biologically plausible (maybe).

This is the order how it is supposed to be versioned.
